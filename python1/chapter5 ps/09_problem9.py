# can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set S?

s =  { 8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]}

# no, you can't change the value inside a list contained in a set in python. In fact , you cannot even have a list as an element in a set because sets in python require all their elements to be immutable and hashable.
